1. **Speed Test**:
   - Checks your download and upload speeds using reliable APIs and benchmarks.
   - Logs results to an SQLite database for tracking consistency over time.

2. **Bandwidth Monitoring**:
   - Monitors real-time internet usage.
   - Identifies network bottlenecks during peak usage times.

3. **AI-driven Optimization (Planned)**:
   - Analyze data patterns using machine learning algorithms.
   - Suggests DNS changes, routing enhancements, and profile-based optimizations.

4. **Web-Based Dashboard (Optional)**:
   - A Flask or FastAPI-powered web interface is being planned.
   - Users can interactively review metrics, track trends, and apply optimizations.
